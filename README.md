DMXUSB emulates the ENTTEC DMX USB Pro Widget API Specification 1.44 on USB serial port. DMXUSB can emulate a single DMX port/universe device like the DMXKing USB ultraDMX Micro or a two port/universe device like the DMXKing ultraDMX Pro. Both devices are compatible with the ENTTEC standard. DMXUSB works with the Open Lighting Architecture (OLA) as a usbserial device.
